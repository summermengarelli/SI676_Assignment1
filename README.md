### METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

**Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:**

Data was generated by cloning Jesse Johnston's Github repository, then creation of a Python script that access the target directory, iterated through its subdirectories, checked for files, and created dictionaries containing those files' metadata. Metadata was then written out to the final CSV file.

**Methods:**

1. Downloading the source data from Jesse Johnston's Github repository was executed using the 'git clone' command line command.

2. The Python script used to generate the data inventory used the 'os', 'datetime', 'hashlib', and 'csv' modules. The script set a file path to the 'data' directory. The function 'get_checksum' was sourced from SI676 course materials and was used to generate MD5 and SHA526 checksums for each file in the 'data' directory. The 'os' function 'os.walk()' was used to iterate through the 'data' directory and its subdirectories and construct the dictioanries containing each file's metadata. Finally, 'csv.DictWriter()' from the 'csv' module was used to write the inventory data out to the CSV dataset found in this repository.

**Instrument/Software-Specific Information:**
    - Software used to write script: Python 3.9.13
    - Python modules: os, datetime, hashlib, csv
